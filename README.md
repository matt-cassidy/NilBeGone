# NilBeGone

Nil got you down, showing up at the wrong time and in the wrong place? Use NilBeGone and change that nil to something else.

Probably shouldn't be used in production.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'NilBeGone'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

## Usage

    nil_value = 5
    other_value = nil
    other_value + 10 == 15
